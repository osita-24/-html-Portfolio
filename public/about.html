<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Ositadinma, a web developer with a focus on creating clean, functional and user‑friendly websites. I work
  confidently with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I’m comfortable using modern frameworks and tools to bring projects to
  life.</p>

<p>I care about both the look and the feel of what I build. Every site I work on is designed to be fast, responsive and
  easy to use, whether it’s viewed on a desktop, tablet or mobile. I take time to write code that’s clear and
  maintainable, so that projects can grow and improve over time without unnecessary hassle.</p>

<p>I enjoy solving problems and turning ideas into working solutions. Whether it’s refining layouts, improving
  performance or integrating new features, I approach each task with care and attention to detail.

  If you’re looking for someone who builds with purpose and keeps the user in mind, I’d be glad to work with you.</p>
